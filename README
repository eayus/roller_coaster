I have used some external libraries, which are NOT MY OWN WORK. Below I have listed the used
libraries and justified their use within the project. The libraries can be found in the "libs"
directory.


GCEM:
    acquired from here: https://github.com/kthohr/gcem
    
    Is used to compute trigonometry function at compile time, the standard library implementations
    of sin/cos are not marked "constexpr"


GLFW:
    installed on DCS machines

    Is used as a more modern and minimal alternative to glut, used for window creation and opengl
    context creation.


STB_image:
    acquire from here: https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h

    Used to load a png image from a file into a byte buffer. Does no OpenGL.
